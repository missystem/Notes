### one part of security is cryptography
* very few of security don't have cryptography on board


### Cryptology
* Cryptography
	1. symmetric algorithms
	2. asymmetric algorithms
	3. protocols
* Cryptanalysis

## 2. Set-up for symmetric cryptography  
(simple) problem: Communication over insecure channel  
```
party A                        			   party B  
Alice                  Oscar     	  		 Bob  
					     y  
			y			 â†‘		   y	
  x	---- e --->  insecure channel --- d --->  x  
```


channel examples:    
- internet  
- airwaves GSM, wifi, ...
